Hi there! 

This project is titled "What's My Line," a piece of interactive media art written in C++ (via openFrameworks) in October 2017. It uses a face tracker, a webcam, and some math to create a live illustration of the observer 


This folder contains the project's source code only. If you would like to run the full project and interact with it yourself, please email me at sskellner28@gmail.com, and I will happily send you a complete folder with full instructions to do it all! 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In this folder, you will find the following items:  
- ofApp.cpp contains the beef of the code I have written
- main.cpp and ofApp.h mostly just set things up
- PolylineWithLerpFunction uses an open-source function for creating smooth points on a line (via a linear interpolation), which I modified to fit my project. I did not invent this math! :) 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Once again, if you would like the instructions to actually run the project, feel free to shoot me an email. 


Enjoy!
